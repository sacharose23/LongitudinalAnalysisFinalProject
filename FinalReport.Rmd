# Abstract
Since previous studies have shown that the highly antioxidant beta-carotene (BC) is associated with a decreased risk of cancer, its pharmacokinetics needs to be better understood. In this study, we used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to confirmed these associations: BC supplementation impacts serum BC levels over time and it varies depending on dosage level, and, after BC supplementation is ceased, the rate at which patients return to baseline does not differ by dosage. It is estimated that the relative difference in mean serum BC comparing patients in the treatment group with patients in the placebo group throughout the 6 month treatment phase is $823.09$ ug/mL (95% CI: [598.18, 1048.00]). This estimate increases to $1055.52$ ug/mL (95% CI: [991.29, 1119.74]) after the potential outlier observations of patient 57 are removed. As secondary analyses, we explored the potential differences in effect of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time by other covariates: gender, cholesterol, age, and body mass index (BMI). We also explored the effect of BC supplementation on serum vitamin E over time. Lastly, we created a predictive linear mixed effects model using Bayesian methods and provided some predictions for randomly chosen patients if they were to extend their duration of the BC supplementation. The biggest challenge with this study was that the data set was greatly unbalanced between those receiving treatment to those receiving placebo (4:1 ratio). These challenges may have affected our models and inferences made. 

# Introduction
Statistics in the 2012 American Cancer Society journal predicted that by year 2030, there will be 21.7 million new cancer cases and 13 million cancer deaths worldwide. When you adjust for other environmental or lifestyle factors like smoking, diabetes, pollution, or fewer childbirths, the numbers can seem very daunting. Studies like this one help us move toward a better understanding of cancer and what we can do to prevent it. Many antioxidants like BC have been used to prevent and battle against cancer. It has been shown that BC is associated with a decreased risk of cancer, but that some physiological factors can affect the absorption, storage, and utilization of the drug, which could then affect the impact it has against cancer. Our analysis seeks to confirm that BC supplementation does significantly impact the serum BC levels over time and that that impact is magnified by higher dosages. We explore the effect of other covariates on the impact of the supplementation, and we also explore the effect that BC supplementation has on serum vitamin E levels over time. We were able to confirm these associations, but, we were unable to create a good predictive model. However, through our association analyses, we made some interesting discoveries that is worth further investigation.

# Methods
These data were collected over the course of 15 months (double-blind) that was split into three phases, which we will call *pre-treatment*, *treatment*, and *post-treatment*. At the start of the study, these baseline measurements were collected from each patient: age, gender, BMI, and cholesterol (time-invariant covariates). On each monthly visit, plasma/serum BC (ug/mL) and plasma/serum vitamin E (ug/mL) were also collected from patients. From months 0 to 3, all patients were on placebo. 46 volunteers were randomized to receive one of five doses of BC (0, 15, 30, 45, or 60 mg/day) for a duration of 6 months (months 4 to 9). Then, after the ninth visit, all patients ceased supplementation and their levels were tracked for another 6 months. However, it is important to note that none of the 46 patients had data on months 11 and 12, and some patients had missing monthly observations. Another interesting note is that there seems to be some patients missing in the study as the patient id numbers extend to 57 even though there is only data for 46 patients. 

Our primary subset of data that we worked with was that during the treatment phase. We did some exploratory analysis in the pre-treatment phase just to get an understanding of our sample in terms of the distributions of serum BC, serum vitamin E, age, gender, BMI, and cholesterol. We also grabbed a baseline serum BC and serum vitamin E measurements by taking the average of those in the pre-treatment phase. This provided a better association model with more efficient estimates and confidence intervals. When investigating the rate at which patients returned to baseline after supplementation, we of course opened up our analysis to the data in post-treatment phase.

Patient 31 had missing serum BC and serum vitamin E levels for month 6. In order to utilize patient 31 in the analysis, that observation was filled in by the fitted value of a simple linear regression model based on the subject-specific trajectory during treatment phase. This seemed to be a reasonable decision instead of throwing away data. Patient 57 did not have missing information, but did seem like an abnormality. This patient's trajectory was clearly showing trends of someone taking BC supplement rather than a placebo. The deviation is blantantly noticeable. It is possible that Patient 57's dose was wrongly noted. Analysis with Patient 57 did not change the majority of our conclusions, but it did have a strong influence as briefly stated in the Abstract. For simplicity, our final models and inference will not include Patient 57.

The randomization of this study eliminates the need to adjust for other covariates besides dose, an indicator for treatment or placebo (predictor of interest), and serum BC (continuous response variable) for our primary scientific questions of interest. We chose to take a semi-parametric approach by fitting generalized estimating equations (GEE). Here we do not need to assume a full distribution on our continuous response variables, serum BC and serum vitamin E, and we could implement a covariance structure since we have inherently correlated data. Huber-White tells us that our regression estimates are consistent even if we misspecify the dependence model. GEE allowed us to gain efficiency in our estimators by assuming an exchangeable covariance structure based on our exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Appendix A. The appropriateness of the models were assessed using residual plots, and we used empirical correlation/covariance matrices and variograms for the EDA on our $\Sigma_i=Cov[Y_{i}]$, which can also be found in Appendix A. To safeguard our inference, we used the robust variance estimates. Implementation of the models was conducted using 'gee' package version 4.13-19 and RStudio version 1.1.414.

$Y_{ij}= \beta_0+\beta_1Tx_i+\beta_2mc.base_{i}+\beta_3month_{ij} + \beta_4Tx_i*month_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij}$ is the GEE model we used for the $i^{th}$ patient and $j^{th}$ measurement where $Y_{ij}$ is the plasma BC levels (ug/mL), $Tx_i$ is an indicator variable for whether or not a patient is on any dose treatment of BC supplementation besides the placebo. $mc.base_{i}$ is the mean-centered averages of plasma BC measurements from the pre-treatment phase. We mean-centered the covariate for better interpretability. $month_{ij}=1,2,..,n_i$ keeps track of the measurements during treatment phase, where $n_i$ is the number of treatment measurements for $i^{th}$ patient. Error terms are assumed independent and centered at zero with an independent covariance matrix.

To investigate whether the impact of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time was dose-dependent, we focused on Treatment Phase and only those who received supplementation. Our mean model here was $E[Y_{ij}]=\beta_0+\beta_1(dose_i/15)+\beta_2mc.base_i+\beta_3t_{ij}+\beta_4t_{ij}(dose_i/15)$. Instead of an indicator variable for treatment, we tranformed dose by dividing by 15 for better interpretability. 


# Results

Recall our mean model fitted in order to investigate the impact of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time: $E[Y_{ij}]= \beta_0+\beta_1Tx_i+\beta_2mc.base_{i}+\beta_3month_{ij} + \beta_4Tx_i*month_{ij}$. If $\beta_1=0$ and $\beta_4=0$, the longitudinal model would be the same regardless of what type of treatment a patient receives. Figure 1 visually shows some support against these null hypotheses as well as the potential influence of Patient 57.

```

Table 1 shows the estimates for these regression parameters after fitting models with and without Patient 57. Let's first consider the model with Patient 57. $\widehat{\beta_1}=823.09$ is the estimated relative difference in mean serum BC comparing treated patients with placebo-treated patients with same average baseline BC measures after one month into the Treatment Phase  (95% CI: [598.18, 1048.00] ug/mL). There is strong evidence that BC supplementation does marginally impact serum BC levels. But, our estimate for $\beta_4 + \beta_3$ is insignificant for this model; we don't have strong evidence that suggests different rates of serum BC between treated and placebo-treated patients.

However, when we eliminate the observations from Patient 57, our inferences change. Our estimate for $\beta_1$ increases to $1055.52$ and the robust standard error decreases so that our new 95% CI is [991.29, 1119.74] ug/mL. This gives us the same conclusion as the previous model, except with more precision and magnitude. The big difference is in our assessment of the trajectories. $\widehat{\beta_4} + \widehat{\beta_3}$ is now significant. We estimate that $18.00$ ug/mL is the relative change in serum BC for every 1 month increase in time among treated patients who start the trial with similar baseline serum BC (95% CI: [4.46, 31.55] ug/mL). In other words, the estimated trajectory of serum BC among treated patients is $11.84$ ug/mL higher than that of placebo-treated patients (95% CI: [1.75, 21.94] ug/mL). Relatively speaking, this is only a slight difference in slope within a six-month period. It's also very important to remember that our sample for placebo-treated patients ($N_P=9$) is very small compared with the treated group ($N_T=35$). So, we must be cautious with our inferences here in general.

The next question of interest is if the impact of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time is dose-dependent, and if so, does the rate at which patients return to baseline after ceasing supplementation also differ by dosage levels. Recall our mean model fitted: $E[Y_{ij}]=\beta_0+\beta_1(dose_i/15)+\beta_2mc.base_i+\beta_3t_{ij}+\beta_4t_{ij}(dose_i/15)$. We will answer both questions with the same model; however, using data from different study phases. For the first part of the question, we focused on the Treatment Phase; for the second part of the question, we focused on the Post-Treatment Phase ($mc.base_i$ will be the mean-centered average of the serum BC levels in the Treatment Phase for the $i^{th}$ patient). In the post-treatment phase, the EDA eluded to an autoregressive-1 working correlation structure. So, unlike the previous models, we fitted the GEE post-treatment model using an AR-1 covariance structure. Our residuals plot shows slight funneling as fitted values increase, so we again used robust variance estimates. 

If $\beta_1=0$ and $\beta_4=0$, then all treated patients ($N_T=35$) would have the same model regardless of their dosage level. Again, here we are only focusing on the treated patients, so Patient 57 is of no concern. Our mean plots in Figure 2 shows that dosage level may be influential during the treatment, but the dosage level may not be influential in the decrease to baseline of serum BC levels post-treatment. The post-treatment trajectories seem to stay parallel with one another with highest dose above and lowest dose below.

```{r table dose outputs}

               caption = "Table 2: Output from GEE Dose-Dependent Model")
kable_styling(kable, latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"), full_width = F)
```

Table 2 shows the output from our model, which will answer our first question about dose-dependency. $\widehat{\beta_1} + \widehat{\beta_4} = 122.46$ ug/mL is the estimated relative difference in the trajectory of serum BC comparing two subpopulations of patients who differ in dosage by 15 ug/mL with similar baseline serum BC (95% CI: [54.23, 190.69] ug/mL). The higher the dosage that a patient receives, the larger their increase of serum BC over time. We have strong evidence to reject our null hypothesis. Our results support our observations from the EDA in Figure 2.

table <- dget("output3")

kable_styling(kable, latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"), full_width = F)
```

Table 3 shows the output from our model, which will answer our second question about dose-dependency. Our suspicions were support by the results. $\widehat{\beta_4} = 11.38$ is statistically insignificant, which tells us that all patients have the same estimated rate of decrease in serum BC levels post-treatment.

kable_styling(kable, latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"), full_width = F)
```

### Gender
Null hypothesis is that there is no difference by age in the effect of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time. Based on our EDA before the treatment, females seemed to have higher BC levels than males. So, it's not too surprising that our model shows males and females having different intercepts; however, we have evidence that supports similar trajectories of BC levels over time between male and female during treatment.

We estimate that males have 148.53 ug/mL lower mean difference in BC levels over time during the treatment than females with similar baseline BC measures (95% confidence interval [-288.94,-8.11]). 

### Age

We fit two models analyzing age as a possible covariate in the effect of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time: age as a categorical variable and age as a continuous variable. 
Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference by age in the effect of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time. Based on our EDA before the treatment, there was weak suspicion of older patients associated with high serum BC levels. So, it's not too surprising that our models show evidence supporting the null; our 95% confidence intervals for our estimates cooresponding to age and the interaction betweenn age and time failed to reject the null.

### BMI

Our models that investigated the effect of baseline BMI on the impact of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time were similar to what we did for age. 

Our null hypothesis for BMI is that there is no difference by BMI in the effect of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time. Based on our EDA before the treatment, there was moderate suspicion of lower BMI patients associated with high serum BC levels. 

Our conclusions seem to differ depending on if we treat BMI as a categorical variable or a continuous variable. As a continuous variable, BMI does not seem to be a change in the effect of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time. But, as a categorical variable, the increase of BMI changes the mean serum BC levels, but not the slopes over time. 

### Cholesterol

Our models that investigated the effect of baseline cholesterol on the impact of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time were similar to what we did for age. 

Our null hypothesis for cholesterol is that there is no difference by cholesterol in the effect of BC supplementation on serum BC levels over time. Based on our EDA before the treatment, there was moderate suspicion of high cholesterol patients associated with high serum BC levels. 

Our conclusions for both models, treating cholesterol as a categorical variable and then as a continuous variable, are similar. Both support a difference in intercepts, but not a difference in trajectories. 

There is strong evidence for a positive correlation between cholesterol and serum BC levels. We estimate that the mean difference in BC levels over time during the treatment comparing two subpopulations that differ in cholesterol by 50 mg/dL with similar baseline BC measures is 133.52 ug/mL (95% confidence interval [68.61, 198.43]). 


```{r vite table}
table <- dget("vite table")
kable <- kable(table, format="latex", booktabs=T, align='c', 
               caption = "Table #: Model Outputs of the Effects BC Supplementation on Serum Vitamin E Levels over Time")
kable_styling(kable, latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"), full_width = F)
```

### Vitamin E CONCLUSIONS
Vitamin E levels in the placebo group seem constant over this time period
Vit E levels in treatment group seem to increase during treatment period and then
decrease substantially after (average being below that of the placebo group)
Spaghetti plots shows a little bit of an increase in Vit E for treatment group after month 14
it's an interesting note, but there is not enough data to understand the change at month 14
maybe the Vit E levels are trending back to levels similar to the placebo group ("normal levels")

there is a significant difference in trajectories between those in treatment and those in placebo during months 10-15 as suspected! no surprises there
there is a significant difference in mean vite e during months 10-15 b/w placebo and tx groups

no significant difference in trajectory between those in treatment and those in placebo during months 4-9
there is a significant difference in mean vite e during months 4-9 b/w placebo and tx groups

### Prediction Model

To build the predictive model, we used Bayesian Inference for linear mixed effects (LME) model. Here, we were able to place non-informative priors and through Gibbs sampling technique able to draw from the posterior distribution of the parameters. From there, we were able to obtain marginal estimates as well as subject-specific random intercepts and slopes. Our covariance matrix for our random effects was assumed to folow an inverse Wishart distribution. Here, we ignored vitamin E levels, BMI, and age based on our exploration of these covariates and their effect on the impact that supplementation had on serum BC levels. Here is our mean model: $$E[Y_{ij}|\vec{b_i}] = \beta_0 + \beta_{C1}Tx_i + \beta_{C2}Male_i + \beta_{C3}Chol_i + \beta_{C4}base_i + \beta_{L1}month_{ij} + \beta_{L2}Tx_i\cdot month_{ij}$$. Implementation of the model was conducted using 'rjags' package version 4-6.
